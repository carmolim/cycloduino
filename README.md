cycloduino
==========

The Cycloduino is a attempt to create a full featured cyclocomputer using an Arduino.  A cyclocomputer or cyclometer is a device mounted on a bicycle that calculates and displays trip information, similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car. The computer with display, or head unit, usually is attached to the handlebar for easy viewing.
